## Project I


### Breadth First Search

- Traverse through one level of children nodes, then traverse through the level of grandchildren nodes (and so on..)

### Depth First Search

- Traverse through left subtree(s) first, then traverse through the right subtree(s)


### Uniform Cost Search

- Searches in branches which are more or less the same in cost.


### About Project I

The code should accept the given graph from the terminal and the three algorithms should search and find the shortest path.

## Project II SolvingCSPs


### Kakuro Puzzle

- Figure below illustrates a simple Kakuros puzzle, solution of the puzzle, input file and the output file.
- Kakuro puzzles are similar with crosswords, but instead of letters the board is filled with digits (from 1 to 9).
- The board's squares need to be filled in with these digits in order to sum up to the specified numbers.
- To solve Kakuros Puzzle using the same digit more than once to obtain a given sum is not allowed.

### About Project II

- Both code files should accept the given input files as "kakuro_input" and "futoshiki_input.txt".
- After running both codes should write outputs into the files as "kakuro_output" and "futoshiki_output.txt"
