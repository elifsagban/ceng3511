# Knapsack Problem and Genetic Algorithm to Solve

 - Knapsack is that given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to
 get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
 - Genetic Algorithm is the code form of Darwin's Evolution Theory. You can see the steps in the picture.

- How to run 

- Initialization of given weight, values and capacity. The aim is find a perfect gen which fits in capacity and has highest value.

- Number of generations by the algorithm generate and max generation are selected by the user.

- Now we have a population and we have to apply parent selection, crossover, mutation and  survival selection 
until we reach max generation.

- The result is in the out.txt with the gen, it's value and weight.
